# How to install PHPWomen website locally

We are planning to provide a step-by-step guide on how to create a local virtual machine containing the development branch.

The guide wraps the instructions provided by [Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) with whatever is needed to have the virtual machine working.

**Currently working on this:**

* [Emily](https://github.com/elstamey)
* [Jenny](https://github.com/missjwo)
* [Damiano](https://github.com/damko)

Please get in touch if you can offer some help
